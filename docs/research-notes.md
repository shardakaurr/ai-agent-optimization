# Research Notes

## AGENTS.md
AGENTS.md is a file that tells an AI agent how it should behave, what rules it must follow, and what style or standards it should maintain.

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)
MCP allows an AI agent to connect with tools and real documentation so that it does not guess or hallucinate information.

## Specification-Driven Development
This means defining clear rules and structure before generating or building something. It helps improve quality and correctness.

## Persona-Based Agents
Personas assign a role to the AI agent, such as content writer or reviewer, to improve focus and output quality.

## Key Learnings
Today I learned how structured instructions and tools improve AI reliability and reduce errors.

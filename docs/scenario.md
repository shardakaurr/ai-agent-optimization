# Project Scenario – AI Agent Optimization for Content Engineering

## Problem Statement
AI coding agents often generate inaccurate, inconsistent, or hallucinated documentation when asked to produce technical user guides and instructions.

## Objective
To optimize an AI agent using AGENTS.md rules, persona-based configuration, MCP tool grounding, and specification-driven development to improve reliability and quality of generated documentation.

## Target User
Technical writers, content engineers, and developer advocates.

## Selected Task
Generate a structured and accurate user guide for a selected developer tool or SDK.

## Baseline Approach
Use a general-purpose AI agent without any configuration or external tool grounding.

## Optimized Approach
Use AGENTS.md, defined personas, MCP integration, and content specifications.

## Success Criteria
- Reduced hallucination and factual errors
- Improved structure and clarity
- Higher compliance with defined specifications
- Reproducible results across runs

# Manual Baseline Analysis

## Summary
The baseline experiment evaluated a general-purpose AI agent generating a beginner user guide for creating a GitHub repository and pushing code.

## Strengths
- Clear step-by-step structure
- Beginner friendly language
- Mostly correct technical instructions

## Weaknesses
- Missing Git configuration steps (username and email)
- Long and verbose explanation
- No strict formatting rules

## Risks Identified
- Beginners may face authentication issues
- Inconsistent outputs across runs
- Hard to maintain consistent quality

## Conclusion
The manual approach produces usable output but lacks consistency, validation, and reproducibility. This motivates the need for a specification-driven optimized approach using AGENTS.md and tooling.
